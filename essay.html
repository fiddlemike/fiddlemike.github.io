      <h1>CS 498: Data Visualization - Final Project Essay </h1>
      <h2>U.S. Gun Violence 2013-2018 Visualization</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The original dataset that I used in the midterm project proved to be too large and unwieldy to use on GitHub Pages so I was forced to hunt for a new data set to visualize. I found the U.S. Gun Violence 2013-2018 data set publicly available on
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> and I decided to work with it. The dataset contains the documentation for 260,000 violent incidents in the United States where a gun was used. Even this dataset
        posed technological problems due to its size (>150mb). I resorted to using R Studio to preprocess the data and exported much smaller csv files to use in the visualizations.

      <h3>Hybrid Structure</h3>
      <p>The narrative visualization hybrid structure chosen was an interactive slideshow. The idea is the viewer can
        <blockquote cite="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-498-dv/lecture/duZCy/9-1-3-the-narrative-spectrum">
          "follow an author directed path through a slideshow. During each slide, you can maybe drill down and list some details or investigate some tangent that you
           might be interested in. Or you can choose just to continue on if you're not interested in the details of that slide."
        </blockquote>
        I choose this hybrid structure because I felt it would be the simplest to implement.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenes</h3>
      <p>I created a html template for the scenes utilizing the Bootstrap toolkit. I wanted each scene to be consistently formatted. The template uses a navigation
        bar header. A div to contain scene navigation and parameters. A main section for the visualization svg that were consistently sized. A div to contain
        relevant information that I felt was important to explain to the viewer and hints on exploring the scene. The scene-intro div was also used to contain
        the “About the Visualization” button.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="rubric3">
      <h3>Anotations</h3>
      <p>The two annotations used in the scenes are the chart titles and the tool tip. The chart titles were changed when the year parameter was updated. This showed the viewer exactly which part of the dataset they were viewing. The tool tip in scene one was used to show the viewer the exact value of the bar. The bar color was also changed to black to show the viewer exactly which bar they were seeing the data for. I scene two the tooltip was used to display information for the viewer. I incident marker size was increased and the color changed to indicate exactly which incident was being used.</p>
